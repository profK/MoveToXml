| Partial Success   | The actor has a limited success. The target is swayed by the actor's confidence and the actor the actor takes +1D6 to their next attempt to manipulate or convince the target. However the target may chose one of the following:\\ <WRAP>
  * Still uncertain. The actor must add to their argument but take +1D6 to all further attempts to convince the target of this one thing.   
  * The target thinks the actor is fill of themselves. The actor's +1D6 is nullified and the target takes 2 points of stress from social consequences.   
  * The target will go along with the target, but they expect a favor down the line. The target gets 1 bond with you
