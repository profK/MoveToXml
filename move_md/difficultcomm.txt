=====Difficult Communication=====
Normally communication between people is just assumed, however a variety of circumstances can make it hard to communicate. They can be physical, such as a noisy or noise-deadening environment, they can be cultural when trying to communicate with someone with very different assumptions or language usage, or they can even be emotional when the other person is not in a good mental space to hear what you are trying to say.

**Important:** Because your result may limit how much you may communicate you should announce your attempt to communicate before the roll, but not what is communicated til afterwards.

**When you try to communicate under difficult circumstances, roll communication.**
