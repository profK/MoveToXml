=====Public Display of Affection=====
In the 80's, this term was a bit of a euphemism. When you talked about two people making a PDA or “PDAing” it meant displaying evidence that they are a couple. Holding hands, putting arms around each other, kissing and in general displaying a romantic involvement. There is no actor or target in a PDA move. Just two characters.  
**When you make a PDA with someone, you roll beauty.**
