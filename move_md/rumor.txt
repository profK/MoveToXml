=====Start A Rumor=====
Rumors are powerful things. If they take they can effect someone's reputations in profound ways. In order to start a rumor, it must have an anchor. An anchor is something that is true and observed by others. The rumor builds on that anchor to make it into something more that may or may not be true. A rumor is also about a person or persons other then the one starting the rumor. They are considered the *target* of the move.

For instance, Dorie and Dave are seen by multiple people leaving the darkest part of the library and seem friendly. Don rolls to start a rumor that Dorie and Dave have been making out in the library. If successful it will impact both Dorie and Dave's reputations.

If a rumor “sticks” then all targets of the rumor have to adjust one reputation up or down 1 tick in a manner that makes sense for the rumor.

**When you try to create rumor, roll communication.**
